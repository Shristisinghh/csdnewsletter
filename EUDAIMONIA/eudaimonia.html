                <p>IGDTUW has taken diverse initiatives setting
                  international benchmarks not only in the academic
                  domain but also in addressing pressing issues of
                  society. The University has made an impact at the
                  individual, family and community levels.
                  The university has launched highly successful social
                  outreach initiatives through the Centre for Sustainable
                  Development aimed at working towards the United
                  Nations Sustainable Development Goals. Six teams,
                  working under CSD, cover 11 different SDG Goals. All
                  the teams have launched comprehensive campaigns
                  about pressing issues related to the SDGs and have
                  disseminated knowledge to more than a thousand
                  students at large.
                  Our objective to create social leaders that are sensitive
                  towards the preservation of the environment have in
                  turn, sensitized the general public too, and the team’s
                  tremendous accomplishments have brought in results.
                  I’m sure that the endeavours of our students will reach
                  out to the readers of this newsletter and bring about a
                  transformation in the way that they perceive their lives
                  and the lives of others. I wish all the best to the CSD
                  team!</p>
