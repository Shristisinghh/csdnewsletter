              <p>IGDTUW has taken diverse initiatives setting
                international benchmarks not only in the academic
                domain but also in addressing pressing issues of
                society. The University has made an impact at the
                individual, family and community levels.
                The university has launched highly successful social
                outreach initiatives through the Centre for Sustainable
                Development aimed at working towards the United
                Nations Sustainable Development Goals. Six teams,
                working under CSD, cover 11 different SDG Goals. All
                the teams have launched comprehensive campaigns
                about pressing issues related to the SDGs and have
                disseminated knowledge to more than a thousand
                students at large.
                Our objective to create social leaders that are sensitive
                towards the preservation of the environment have in
                turn, sensitized the general public too, and the team’s
                tremendous accomplishments have brought in results.
                I’m sure that the endeavours of our students will reach
                out to the readers of this newsletter and bring about a
                transformation in the way that they perceive their lives
                and the lives of others. I wish all the best to the CSD
                team!</p>
